# ColdFusion USPS API CFC

This is a ColdFusion CFC used to connect to USPS API using OAuth.

## Requirements
* ACF 11+
* Lucee 5+

To authenticate with the USPS API, use your application's Consumer KEY and SECRET. If you don't have these credentials, setup your application from https://developers.usps.com.

## Initialization

This will init the USPS Component cfc and setup testing or production URL.

**CreateObject()**

	variables.uspsapi = CreateObject('component', 'cfcname').init(developmentServer=true);

**New Keyword**

	variables.uspsapi = New cfcname(developmentServer=true);

## Sample Usage

See uspstest.cfm.

Steps:
	1. Retrieve site token. This is not a user specific token requiring them to login to USPS.
	(Store token and expiration somewhere you can retrieve such as a DB. Sample just uses a cookie. You can the use same key until expiration where you will need to get a new token)
	2. Use setters to initialize the properties for the component.
	3. Call API passing token and component variable.

## Response

Result for API will be structure from the deserialized JSON.
